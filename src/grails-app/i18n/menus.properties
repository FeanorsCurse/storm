menu.path.help=The data you enter here determines where in the hierarchy of menu \
  options this option will appear. If you enter a value such as 'accounts', then \
  you are specifying an option of the main menu. A path such as 'accounts.inventory' \
  specifies that the option is to be displayed in the sub-menu with the path of \
  'accounts'. The 'accounts' path record must already exist. Changing the path \
  of an exiting record will reposition it (and its children if it is a sub-menu) \
  within the menu hierarchy. NOTE however, that any changes to the internationalization \
  texts of your system have to be done manually. Also note that only letters, \
  digits and the dot (.) conjunction character are allowed within a path definition.
menu.title.help=This is the text that will be displayed for the option when it is \
  shown in a menu.
menu.sequencer.help=The number you enter here determines where, within the menu \
  or sub-menu to which this option belongs (per the Path definition), the option \
  will be displayed. We suggest that you leave gaps between option sequencer numbers \
  (e.g. 10, 20 30 rather than 1, 2, 3) to accomodate later option insertions. It \
  is possible to have duplicate sequencer numbers within a particular menu path, \
  but this rather defeats the object!
menu.type.help=Choose the type of option this record represents.
menu.command.help=For a controller and action option type, enter the controller and \
  action separated by a dot, as in: inventory.list. For a sub-menu option type, \
  leave this field blank. For an external URL option type, enter the full URL that \
  you would like the option to go to (e.g. http://www.google.com). For an operating \
  system program, enter the program name and, where required, its file suffix \
  (e.g. my_program.exe). Depending upon how your operating system is set up, you \
  may need to type in the full path of the program (e.g. c:\\development\my_program.exe). \
  You may also be able to put 'command line' parameters after the program name \
  (e.g. myprogram -nodump) etc.
menu.parameters.help=For a controller and action option type, enter any parameters \
  you wish to pass. Parameters are entered as a comma separated list of pairs. For \
  example: sort:itemCode, max:50. This will pass two parameters to the target \
  controller.action, one called 'sort' with a value of 'itemCode' and the other \
  called 'max' with a value of '50'. For an external URL option type, enter any \
  parameters you would like to pass to the URL. This will be passed after the URL \
  using '?sort=itemCode&max=50' etc. For an operating system program, enter the \
  environment variables you would like to pass to the program. The program will \
  'see' the variables as sort=itemCode and max=50 etc. Note that if you include \
  a parameter with the name 'dir_' then its value will be taken to be the directory \
  that should be changed to before the program is executed. For a sub-menu option \
  type, enter text that should be displayed at the top of the page when this sub-menu \
  is displayed. If you leave this field blank, the the option's title will be \
  used as the menu title.
