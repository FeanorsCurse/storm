# Place the internationalized texts for your menus in this message bundle.
# You will need, first of all, a title for the main menu which will be displayed
# at the top of the page when the top-level menu is displayed:
#
# mainmenu=Main Menu
#
# For each menu option in your system, you will need an option title that is
# keyed on the word 'option' plus the path of the option. For example, an option
# in a second level menu with a path of 'accounts.inventory' would have its
# title defined as follows:
#
# option.accounts.inventory=Inventory Processing
#
# Each menu option in your system can be displayed in a breadcrumb trail. The
# crumb for any particular option defaults to the last node in its path (the
# 'inventory' part of 'accounts.inventory' in the preceding example. If you want
# to internationalize the crumb for a particular option, then continuing the
# above example...
#
# crumb.accounts.inventory=stock
#
# A crumb definition without a following path, is the definition for the main
# menu crumb, as follows:
#
# crumb=main
#
# When menu options are displayed, sub-menus listed in the current menu page
# have an option title just like any other option in the list. When that
# sub-menu is displayed, the menu title displayed at the top of its page defaults
# to the option title that was used in the parent menu. However, you can change
# this using a sub-menu option:
#
# submenu.accounts.inventory=Inventory Sub-Menu
#
# Without this submenu entry (and continuing the previous examples), the heading
# at the top of the sub-menu page would have been 'Inventory Processing'
