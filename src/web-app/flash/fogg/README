			FOggPlayer
			==========

This is a simple Ogg Vorbis player written in HaXe, a new object
oriented language aimed at scripting languages like ActionScript,
JavaScript etc. See http://haxe.org. The Ogg Vorbis decoder is the
soundapi branch of FOgg, from https://launchpad.net/fogg. It also uses
swfmill to build an embedded font resource. See http://swfmill.org.

Building
========
You can either use the build files, build.bat or build.sh, or use gnu
make with the Makefile.

Using
=====
There are three buttons, the title field, and a volume control.  The
buttons operate in the usual way, except that clicking the play button
(|>) while a file is playing will restart from the last pause
position, or the beginning if the pause button (||) or the title
hasn't been clicked. Clicking the stop button ([]) will stop the
playing, and reset the pause position.

Clicking on the title field will stop the playing and set a new pause
position.

Clicking on the volume control will set the volume in proportion to
where it is clicked.

HTML
====
The minimum necessary html code is:

<object
   type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
   data="FOggPlayer.swf?url=http://...&title=...&colour=..."
   width="350"
   height="21">
  <param
     name="movie"
     value="FOggPlayer.swf?url=http://...&title=...&colour=..." />
</object>

Parameters
==========
url	- URL of mp3 file
title	- Title of mp3 file
color	- Colour for progress bar (optional)
colour	- Alternate spelling for color

Colours
=======
Colour can be one of: red green blue cyan yellow magenta, or two hex
numbers separated by a comma, like this: #ffffff,#bbbbbb.

The first value sets the colour of the top of the progress bar, the
second sets the bottom, with a gradient between.  To retain the 3D
effect the second colour needs to be darker than the first.

The progress bar colour defaults to cyan, if not defined, or there is
an error in the parameter.
